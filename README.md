# master-solana

 using keygen script I generated wallet.json and wallet2.json.

 on wallet (1) I requested an airdrop in order to get $SOL and be able to do transactions on the chain.

 using wallet1 I created an spl token (still no metadata) with createMint method.
 then I minted 100 tokens using the same wallet.

 then I transfered 50 tokens from wallet (1) to wallet2.

 then checking the balances of both wallets I can see each wallet has 50 tokens.
